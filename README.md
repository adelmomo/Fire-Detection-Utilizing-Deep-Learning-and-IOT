# Fire Detection Utilizing Deep Learning and IOT
  Fire Detection Utilizing Deep Learning and IOT is is a real-time detection system using a deep convolutional neural network and a raspberry pi node where the deep learning model is implemented in the raspberry pi node. The objective of this project is to be implemented in facilities or in houses, once a fire is detected the raspberry pi sends a warning message to the email or the Whatsapp of the facility's or house's owner using cloud computing services.
  To run this project you need to move the project to your raspberry pi node, then run the main.py file.
